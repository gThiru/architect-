Implement protection mechanisms for failed password attempts.

Use different error messages each time.
Prompt an answer to a secret question along with user name and password (after one or two attempts)
Use lockout time that increases with each failed attempt
Use captcha to prevent automated password guessing
Restrict direct access to authentication URLs
You should salt passwords before hashing them (Salting is a process that strengthens file encryption and hashes, making it more difficult to author a brute force attack. The salt is added as an input to the hash function along with the password.  The salt value is then stored with the resultant hash so that the same salt is later used with the password presented by the user.  The stored hash will match the new hash when the correct password is presented by the user.)
